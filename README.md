The Public API of PrivatBank allows obtaining information about cash currency exchange rates of PrivatBank and the National Bank of Ukraine (NBU) for a selected date. The archive stores data for the last 4 years.

Write a console utility that returns the USD and EUR exchange rates of PrivatBank for the past few days. Set a limitation that the utility can only display the currency exchange rates for the past 10 days. Use the Aiohttp client to make requests to the API. Adhere to the SOLID principles when writing the task. Handle network request errors correctly.
